A Python script for real-time interactive fitting of fluorescence spectroscopy data to obtain the glass transition temperature (Tg)

Incorporates JavaScript callback in Bokeh framework

In addition to the browser-based fitting of Tg, provides further analysis tools that graph in the console
  Plotting of first and second derivative of intensity
  MSE plot showing where rubber-state linearity in data falls off

Takes as input: 
  comma delimited .txt file containing times and fluorescence intensities
